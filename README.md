# UCLA-CS-M152A
These are my solutions to the labs and final project for CSM152A - Digital Design Lab as taught by Professor Potkonjak and TA Babak Moatamed. These labs were created with the help of my lab partner Kevin Xu. Feel free to use this code as inspiration/guidance, but copying directly from this will be at your own risk!
